# Empires-Mod
The Empires Mod is a protection system mod for heavily modded minecraft.
The Mod is designed to allow players maximum protection yet still be able to raid one another.
Essentially players are safe until they lack the stregnth to defend their territory from raids.
At that point of time, the Empire's claimed chunks can be unclaimed by other empires to unlock loot.

# Compatibility
This mod is compatible with MyTown2's user generated protection files.
